Once the waypoints arrive, my code executes and reaches the first waypoint in a very short amount of time \\(less than 10 seconds\\). However, checking the /vrx/wayfinding/min\\_errors and mean\\_error topic shows that no score has been computed yet. Immediately after achieving the first goal, my code targets the second waypoint and approaches it. While continuing to monitor the /vrx/wayfinding/min\\_errors topic, I notice that it only starts publishing data once the WAMV has travelled more than 10 meters away from the first waypoint as the min\\_error now reads : \\[10,160, 160\\]. After completion of the entire task, the min error reads something like \\[10,2,2\\]. This leads me to conclude that the scoring plugin only starts some time after the waypoints are provided. I have only tested against the wayfinding\\_task world but have not yet tried the new automated testing worlds that you guys have put up for phase 2. But I guess it is unlikely that this will affect anything for phase 2 if the first waypoint is not very near the start position of the WAMV.
