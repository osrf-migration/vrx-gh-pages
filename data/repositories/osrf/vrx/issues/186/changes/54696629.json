The fix is to make sure we set enable\\_color\\_checker to false in our dock \\(\u201cscan\u201d\\) task worlds. We may also want to fix it in the worlds we\u2019ve already released and in the yaml that generates them.", "old": "As mentioned in this forum thread, it appears that we left the color checker on in our dock tasks, which allowed Georgia tech to score 10 points in the dress rehearsal by sending the default color sequence even though no light buoy was displayed.
