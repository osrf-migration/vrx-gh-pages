The west lakes image I linked to was an accumulation of several passes of the lidar, and beyond the vehicle, shore and test docking area (shown here: https://csem.flinders.edu.au/competitions/maritime_robotx/images/gallery/west_lakes_docking.jpg) only a small scattering of returns can be seen.  I interpret these returns as coming from the water surface.  There may be places where the water is shallow enough for a return to come from the floor, but in the RobotX course area, I expect such returns would be minimal.\n\nThanks for your support, I will put together a pull request for velodyne_simulator.\n\nRegards,\nJonathan.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi Carlos,</p>\n<p>I cannot tell you exactly how far through the water surface that a lidar will give a return, but I can state that my experience has been that such returns have been very rare.
