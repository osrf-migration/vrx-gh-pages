I still have some reservations about the scoring metric--I think the main motivation for the choice of Euclidean distance is to get something that seems \"natural\" but I don't think there's really a natural metric for what we are trying to measure, and this approach seems to incentivize some odd behavior. For example, if a drift away from the goal, a common-sense response would be to turn around and head back to it. Then, once I'm in the right place (or at least close) I would probably work on keeping the correct orientation.\n\nIn our case, if we are always scoring offset and orientation error simultaneously, it would be better for me to keep my orientation as correct as possible the whole time, while trying to slide myself back toward the goal position. This seems to give the holonomic configuration a big advantage. It also seems like it rewards a capability that, at least from my limited perspective, does not appear to be very important. Also, while this may not be a huge problem for stationkeeping (assuming the vehicles can stay relatively close to the goal throughout) it will show up again if we re-use this metric during the wayfinding task.\n\nWe can probably improve the situation with a clever weighting scheme (especially if the weight is also a function of position) but I think we will be fighting the bias of the model. Instead, I would advocate embracing the game-like nature of the challenge, and using a more obviously artificial scoring system.
