Is that normal ? I deleted one and that works fine.\" \n\nYou are absolutely right. This tutorial was created a week ago to demonstrate how to use `generate_wamv.launch`, which, at the time, had no compliance issues; it would accept any configuration. Just a few days ago, we merged in a pull request adding configuration restraints, which limits the number of sensors and requires physically realizable sensor locations. That is described here: [#!/osrf/vrx/src/default/vrx\\_gazebo/src/vrx\\_gazebo\\_python/generator\\_scripts/wamv\\_config/sensor\\_compliance/numeric.yaml](#!/osrf/vrx/src/default/vrx_gazebo/src/vrx_gazebo_python/generator_scripts/wamv_config/sensor_compliance/numeric.yaml).
