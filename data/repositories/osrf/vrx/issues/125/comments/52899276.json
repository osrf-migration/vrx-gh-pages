Thank you for helping us see where we can improve. I hope that we were able to help.\n\nResponse to your questions:\n\n1. Great to hear!

At a high level:\n\n    1. `roslaunch vrx_gazebo sandisland.launch`  runs the boat simulation with the default sensor and thruster configuration\n    2. `roslaunch vrx_gazebo sandisland.launch urdf:=<absolute_path_to_urdf>` runs the boat simulation with the sensor and thruster configuration specified in `<absolute_path_to_urdf>`.
