If you look at [pull request 216](#!/osrf/vrx/pull-requests/216/fix-issue-188/diff), you can see that generation of URDF from the yaml file format has changed for the GPS and IMU sensor. As such, even my old custom URDF build was no longer working but all I had to do was regenerate the URDF based on the command provided in the [generating URDF tutorial](#!/osrf/vrx/wiki/tutorials/Creating%20a%20custom%20WAM-V%20Thruster%20and%20Sensor%20Configuration%20For%20Competition).
