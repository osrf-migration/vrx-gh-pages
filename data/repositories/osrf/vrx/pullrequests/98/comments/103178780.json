How does the post fit in with the boat and lidar? Is Lidar on the top and boat at bottom? How does the ball\\+triangle section mesh with the boat?\n2. There was no png in the Post folder. Inside the `Post.DAE` file, it has `file://H:\\Dropbox\\Cole\\VRX\\WamV\\GPS\\GPS_Diffuse.png`. Is this the right png? If so, could you please share it here? I do not think I have access to that folder.\n3. How would you recommend including the post on the WAM-V? Should it be another link in the same 3d lidar macro in `wamv_gazebo/urdf/sensors/wamv_3d_lidar.xacro`?
