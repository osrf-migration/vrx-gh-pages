The PR includes a few commits in an effort to document the integration which was done in a few distinct steps:\r\n\r\n1.

This suggests that it might be reasonable to use a zero steepness value for the physical waves, which would alleviate the need for the multidimensional root search for the wave height (see Newton\u2019s method solver in WaveSampler::ComputeDepthDirectly within <a data-is-external-link=\"true\" href=\"http://Wavefield.cc\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wavefield.cc</a>).  Currently this doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem, but as the models get complex this simplification may have computational advantages.  Would certainly want to test under other scenarios.</li>\n</ul>", "type": "rendered"}, "created_on": "2019-03-09T01:58:45.532747+00:00", "user": {"display_name": "Brian Bingham", "uuid": "{9cdea257-248f-486e-8858-49d8485a916f}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7B9cdea257-248f-486e-8858-49d8485a916f%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7B9cdea257-248f-486e-8858-49d8485a916f%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "https://avatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.net/557058:6c52d6e5-77e0-41a8-8b6e-cb9462f4d5f1/7a690884-fc47-4bca-9c2b-baecee4d3dc9/128"}}, "nickname": "brian_bingham", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:6c52d6e5-77e0-41a8-8b6e-cb9462f4d5f1"}, "updated_on": "2019-03-09T01:58:45.540046+00:00", "type": "pullrequest_comment", "id": 94388711}, "pull_request": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 81, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/vrx/pullrequests/81.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/vrx/pull-requests/81"}}, "title": "Integrating new method for implementing visual and physical wave field."}}, {"update": {"description": "This PR would bring the code from the [ASV Wave Sim](https://github.com/srmainwaring/asv_wave_sim/tree/feature/vrx) project by [Rhys Mainwaring](https://bitbucket.org/srmainwaring) into VRX.
